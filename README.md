# Stock-Prices

Welcome everyone, 

In this project is intersting and fachnating to me when i tried it. Let me explain why. Here is our goals:

1- We will be using python libraray web application called streamlit
2-We will build data science web app 
3- We will be using stock prices data 

Skills used:

1-Streamlit 
2-Pamdas
2-Python 

Resuources used:

1-youtube.com
2-towardsdatascience.com

Notes:
1- This is indivisiual contribution.
2- I built the entire project.

Finally, This is one my personal projects to boost my skills in data analysis and data science in general 

Let us start. 

1) We have to install streamlit in our device by using this command :

2) we have to install yfinance because we are dealing with stocks anyways:

3) right now, we need to create python file by using a text editor and save it empty. The only thing is unique is the file name, the extenstin will be .py:

4) After saving the file, install Atom in your device and open the file you just saved. 

5) In every data project i learned taht, it is must to import these two libraries along with yfinance of course:

6) now I have to type title of the project:
